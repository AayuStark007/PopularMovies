# PopularMovies
An app to view the most popular and top rated movies on your android phone. This app was made as a part of the final project for Udacity's Android Developer course.

##Installation
####Generating the API Key:
* To make the app work, you will need the API Key from themoviedb.org.
  + If you donâ€™t already have an account, you will need to create one in order to request an API Key.
  + In your request for a key, state that your usage will be for educational/non-commercial use. You will also need to provide some personal information to complete the request. Once you submit your request, you should receive your key via email shortly after.

####Adding the API Key to the app:
* Put the API Key in your ~/gradle.properties file (create a new file if not present) as,
  `MyTheMovieDBApiKey={API Key}`
  Where {API Key} is your API Key between double quotes.
